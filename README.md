- printui.jar is the source code
- printui-apps-0.9-5.zip is the apps/PrintUI plus apps/cq/.../nav overlays
- printui-content-1.0-SNAPSHIOT.zip is the compiled code bundle.

1. Install the two packages.
2. Visit http://localhost:4502/apps/PrintUI/choose-template.html

Things are working up to what I am working on now which is on save-job where I need to show the proper preview.

Saves work properly. Only issue is the dc:title metadata on pdfs which sometimes takes and sometimes overwrites from the workflows.
